# Oauth2 Features

Stormpath provides two Oauth2 workflows, client credential and password.  In
this document we discuss how these should be exposed in the developer's web
application.



## OAuth2 Configuration Options

The OAuth2 endpoint can be configured, or disabled entirely:

```yaml
web:
  oauth2:
    enabled: true
    path: "/oauth/token"
```

#### web.oauth2.enabled

By default we accept POSTS to this token path and respond according to the
grant type.  If the developer sets this value to false we should not attach any
handler to this path, allowing the framework to return it's default 404 response.

If enabled and the grant type is not `client_credentials` or `password`, then we
should return the OAuth-compliant error code:

    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
    Cache-Control: no-store
    Pragma: no-cache

    {
      "error": "unsupported_grant_type"
    }

If no grant type is specified, the error should be `invalid_request`

## Client Credentials Grant Flow

The product guide for this feature can be found here:

https://docs.stormpath.com/guides/api-key-management/

In this workflow, an api key and secret is provisioned for a stormpath account.
These credentials can be exchanged for an access token by making a POST request
to `/oauth/token` on the web application.  The request must look like this:

````
POST /oauth/token
Authorization: Basic <base64UrlEncoded(apiKeyId:apiKeySecret)>

grant_type=client_credentials
````

For this flow the underlying Stormpath SDK is used for generating the access
token and verifying that the API key & secret is valid, and that the account is
not disabled.  The response is an access token response, but this flow does not
return a refresh token (only an access token):

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache

{
  "access_token":"2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA...",
  "expires_in":3600,
  "token_type":"Bearer"
}
```

### Client Credentials Options

```yaml
web:
  oauth2:
    client_credentials:
      enabled: true
      accessToken:
        ttl: 3600
```

#### web.oauth2.client_credentials.enabled

If set to false, the endpoint should return the `unsupported_grant_type` error
(see above).

#### web.oauth2.client_credentials.accessToken.ttl

Determines how long the issued token should be valid for, as seconds.

## Password Grant Flow

The product guide for this feature can be found here:

http://docs.stormpath.com/guides/token-management/

In this workflow, an account can post their login (username or email) and
password to the `/oauth/token` endpoint, with the following body data:

````
POST /oauth/token

grant_type=password
&username=<username>
&password=<password>
````

Although the Oauth2 spec requires the parameter to be named `username`, this
value can also be the email address of a Stormpath account.

The framework should use the underlying SDK to exchange these credentials
for an access token response, using the `/oauth/token` endpoint of the
Stormpath Application that is specified in the configuration.

If the login is successful, we respond with an access token and refresh token.
The format of the response should be an OAuth2 access token response, which
looks like this:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache

{
  "access_token":"2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA",
  "expires_in":3600,
  "refresh_token":"tGzv3JOkF0XG5Qx2TlKWIA",
  "token_type":"Bearer"
}
```

## Password Grant Options

```yaml
web:
  oauth2:
    password:
      enabled: true
      validationStrategy: stormpath # or 'local' to do local JWT signature validation
```


#### web.oauth2.password.enabled

If set to false, the endpoint should return the `unsupported_grant_type` error
(see above).

#### web.oauth2.password.validationStrategies

Determines how we validate an access token.  There are two strategies:

* **local** - only verify the signature, expiration, and issuer

* **stormpath** - always validate against Stormpath, for additional checks
  such as Account and Application status.  This is the default, but the most
  consistent (will always be aware of Stormpath resource statuses).

The underlying SDK must have authenticators which can do either type of
validation.  The purpose of this configuration option is to inform the framework
intergration as to which type of authenticator it should build and use for
authentication attempts.
